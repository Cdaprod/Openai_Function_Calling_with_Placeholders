If you want to ignore fields in the OpenAI API request that are not provided in the input JSON (i.e., they are `None` or not present), you could modify the code like so:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import os
import requests
import json

app = Flask(__name__)

def clean_dict(d):
    """Remove keys with the value `None` in a dictionary, recursively."""
    return {
        k: clean_dict(v) if isinstance(v, dict) else v
        for k, v in d.items()
        if v is not None and v != ""
    }

@app.route('/api/openai', methods=['POST'])
def openai_api():
    try:
        data = request.get_json()

        # Check if data is None (i.e., no data was provided in the request)
        if not data:
            return jsonify({"error": "No data provided"}), 400

        # Clean the data dictionary
        data = clean_dict(data)

        # Define headers
        headers = {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': f"Bearer {os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')}",
        }

        # Make the POST request
        response = requests.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))

        # Check if the request was successful
        if response.status_code != 200:
            return jsonify({"error": "OpenAI API request failed", "details": response.json()}), response.status_code

        # Return the response
        return jsonify(response.json()), response.status_code

    except Exception as e:
        # An unexpected error occurred, return 500 and the error message
        return jsonify({"error": "An unexpected error occurred", "details": str(e)}), 500

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this version of the script, there is a new function `clean_dict` that removes keys from the dictionary where the value is `None` or an empty string (`""`). This function is called on the input data before the POST request to the OpenAI API is made.

Please note that this version of the script will remove all keys with `None` or empty string values from the dictionary, even if they are nested in other dictionaries. This behavior is recursive.
