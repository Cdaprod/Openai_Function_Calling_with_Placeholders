If you want to introduce GraphQL to your Flask API and work on it in a separate branch, here are the steps you can follow:

**Step 1:** First, create a new branch. If you're using git from the command line, you can do this with the `git checkout` command with the `-b` option, which creates a new branch and switches to it. For example:

```
git checkout -b graphql_implementation
```

**Step 2:** Next, you will want to install the necessary libraries for working with GraphQL in Python. One of the most popular is Graphene. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install graphene
```

**Step 3:** Now, you can start implementing your GraphQL schema. Here's a basic example:

```python
import graphene

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    hello = graphene.String(description='A typical hello world')

    def resolve_hello(self, info):
        return 'Hello World!'

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)
```

This is a simple GraphQL schema with one query (`hello`) that returns a string.

**Step 4:** Once your schema is defined, you can integrate it into your Flask app. Flask-GraphQL is a Flask extension that provides a straightforward way to integrate. Install it with pip:

```
pip install flask-graphql
```

You can then add a route in your Flask app to serve the GraphQL schema:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_graphql import GraphQLView
from schema import schema  # assuming your schema is defined in a file named schema.py

app = Flask(__name__)
app.add_url_rule('/graphql', view_func=GraphQLView.as_view('graphql', schema=schema, graphiql=True))
```

The `graphiql=True` argument means that the GraphiQL tool for testing your GraphQL API will be available at the `/graphql` route.

**Step 5:** After you have implemented your changes, you can commit them:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Implemented basic GraphQL schema"
```

**Step 6:** Finally, when you're finished with your changes, you can merge your branch back into the main branch. First, switch back to the main branch:

```
git checkout main  # or master, depending on your setup
```

Then merge your `graphql_implementation` branch:

```
git merge graphql_implementation
```

These steps should give you a basic introduction to implementing a GraphQL schema in a Flask app. The schema in this example is quite simple, so you'll likely need a more complex schema for a real application.

Note: Be sure to handle possible merge conflicts during the merge process. It's also a good idea to ensure your tests pass after the merge before pushing to a shared repository or deploying to production.
