To create a GraphQL schema for your `openai_function_calling_with_placeholders.git` project, you would define your query and mutation types using Graphene. For this project, let's assume you want to make a mutation that represents the action of calling the OpenAI API. This mutation would take the same inputs as the OpenAI API function.

Here is a basic example:

```python
import graphene
from graphene import InputObjectType, String, Field

class FunctionParameter(graphene.InputObjectType):
    name = graphene.String(required=True)
    type = graphene.String(required=True)
    description = graphene.String(required=True)

class Function(graphene.InputObjectType):
    name = graphene.String(required=True)
    description = graphene.String(required=True)
    parameters = graphene.List(FunctionParameter)

class OpenAIAPICallInput(graphene.InputObjectType):
    model = graphene.String(required=True)
    messages = graphene.List(String, required=True)  # Simplifying messages here
    functions = graphene.List(Function)

class OpenAIAPICallOutput(graphene.ObjectType):
    response = graphene.String()

class CallOpenAIAPIMutation(graphene.Mutation):
    class Arguments:
        openai_api_call_input = OpenAIAPICallInput(required=True)
    
    Output = OpenAIAPICallOutput

    def mutate(root, info, openai_api_call_input):
        # Call your OpenAI API function here with the data from openai_api_call_input
        # ...
        # Use the response to create your OpenAIAPICallOutput object
        response_data = "..."  # replace this with your actual response data
        return OpenAIAPICallOutput(response=response_data)

class Mutation(graphene.ObjectType):
    call_openai_api = CallOpenAIAPIMutation.Field()

schema = graphene.Schema(mutation=Mutation)
```

In this example, the `CallOpenAIAPIMutation` class represents a mutation that calls the OpenAI API. The `Arguments` class within it defines the input to this mutation, which matches the data for the API call. The `mutate` method is where you would call your function to make the API call.

The `OpenAIAPICallInput` and `Function` classes define the structure of the input data for the API call, while the `OpenAIAPICallOutput` class defines the structure of the data returned by the API call.

Please note that this is a basic example and may need to be expanded or adjusted to suit your exact requirements.
