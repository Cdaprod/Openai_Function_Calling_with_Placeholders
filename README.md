# README for OpenAI Function Calling with Placeholders

This repository contains a Python script for making API calls to OpenAI's chat models with function calling capability. The script uses environment variables to make the API request flexible and adaptable to different use-cases.

## Requirements

To run the script, you need Python installed on your machine along with the following Python packages:

- `openai`
- `requests`
- `python-dotenv`
- `json`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. First, you need to set up your environment variables. Copy the content below into a new file named `.env` in the same directory as your script:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
MODEL_NAME=MODEL_NAME

SYSTEM=SYSTEM_PLACEHOLDER
SYSTEM_CONTENT=SYSTEM_CONTENT_PLACEHOLDER

USER=USER_PLACEHOLDER
USER_CONTENT=USER_CONTENT_PLACEHOLDER

FUNCTION_NAME=FUNCTION_NAME_PLACEHOLDER
FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION=FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER

PARAMETER_TYPE=PARAMETER_TYPE_PLACEHOLDER

PROPERTY_NAME_1=PROPERTY_NAME_PLACEHOLDER
PROPERTY_TYPE_1=PROPERTY_TYPE_PLACEHOLDER
PROPERTY_DESCRIPTION_1=PROPERTY_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER

PROPERTY_NAME_2=PROPERTY_NAME_PLACEHOLDER_2
PROPERTY_TYPE_2=PROPERTY_TYPE_PLACEHOLDER_2
PROPERTY_DESCRIPTION_2=PROPERTY_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER_2

REQUIRED=REQUIRED_PLACEHOLDER
```

2. Replace each `PLACEHOLDER` with the actual value you want to use in your API request. For example, `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` should be replaced with your actual OpenAI API key.

3. Once your `.env` file is set up, you can run the Python script with the following command:

```bash
python fuction_.py
```

The script will load the environment variables from the `.env` file, construct the API request based on those variables, and send the request to OpenAI's API. The response from the API will be printed to the console.

Please note that this is a basic template and might need to be adjusted based on the specifics of your use-case. For example, you might need to add more properties or adjust the data structure based on the API you're calling.
